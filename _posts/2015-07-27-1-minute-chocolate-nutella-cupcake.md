Last course to my 'Back to School' 5-Course special - microwavable cupcakes! Each cupcake takes 1-minute in the microwave and uses boxed cake mix, which is perfectly convenient for the college student or those who want to make a dessert on the go. Check the site for more back to school recipes! Recipe (Makes 6) 1/3 Batter from boxed cake mix (+ 4 teaspoon more water mixed in), 6 tablespoons Nutella, 2 tablespoons rainbow sprinkles, 12 strawberries for garnish
