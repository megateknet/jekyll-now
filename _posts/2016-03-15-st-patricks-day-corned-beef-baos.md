I love whenever St. Patrick's Day rolls around and Anna's Taqueria does their corned beef burritos.  Corned beef is so flavorful and goes well with so many things.  It's amazing in a sandwich and naturally I thought it would go very well as filling for baos.  I used a pre-mix for my baos to keep this recipe quick, but you can certainly make your own.
