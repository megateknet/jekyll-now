Ok, phase two.  Cocktail buns.  What are they?  My favorite  item at the Chinese bakery.  Ok, but what IS it? What does it consist of?  Super soft, milk-enriched bread with a crumbly coconut and butter filling. It's said to have originated from Hong Kong, and actually, the Cantonese name for the cocktail bun literally translates into "chicken tail" bun.  I love it because of the contrasting textures in the filling and just the aromatics from sweetened coconut and butter melting together.  Note that you need the [Chinese Sweet Bun Dough Recipe](http://www.eastmeetskitchen.com/recipes/chinese-sweet-bun-dough.html) to make the pillowy soft, milk-enriched dough, which is ever so slightly sweetened. 



###Directions

####1. Using a small whisk or fork, beat together butter and sugar till just combined.
