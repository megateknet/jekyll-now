I've sort of been in this love affair with Union Square Donuts ever since I discovered the small little gourmet doughnut shop nestled right in the heart of Union Square.  The shop sort of exploded from then and I knew if I wasn't able to get my butt out of bed before 10 a.m. on a Saturday or Sunday, then my doughnuts would pretty much be sold out by the time I got there.  

Luckily, Union Square Donuts just expanded to a shop of their own - bigger and with more doughnut flavors!  There's a cute sitting area (limited spacing though) and now that they serve coffee, it definitely has more of that bakery/caf√© feel.  Anyways, thought I would just give you a tour of the place.




__The Storefront - kind of Californian.  20 Bow Street - just a couple shops down from the old one.__

__All of the doughnuts neatly displayed.  Heard they will be doing some savory flavors as well!__
