This jelly is made from agar and infused with a dessert sake I bought from Japan.  For those who are not familiar, agar is a gelatinizing agent made from seaweed and is actually very rich in fiber.  Yes, it is the same stuff they used in petri dishes during science class, but just try to disassociate the two.  Agar is a wondering vegan option to gelatin.  It doesn't need to be chilled to set, although you would want to eat this dessert chilled.  Agar also has a different texture and bite to it than gelatin.  It's less springy and chewy.  For those familiar with Asian desserts, you'll actually see a lot more gelatins or puddings made with agar as opposed to gelatin.
