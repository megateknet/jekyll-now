These are the cookies you want to be making if it's 8pm on a Sunday night and you get the sudden cravings for peanut butter cookies.

I originally got this recipe off of a Foodnetwork gluten free recipe, but I in no way chose to make these for health related reasons.  I chose this recipe because it had 5 ingredients (3-4 of which you can find in probably 90% of households) and you an make it in one bowl.  From start to finish - baking time included, these cookies take a total of about 15 minutes to make.  There's no butter.  You don't have to cream anything.  I made mine with a single fork.  It was just one of those recipes where I  knew I had all the ingredients, where I knew I didn't have to clean twenty different items afterward, and where I knew that in 15 minutes (prep and bake time included) I would be eating some yummy peanut butter cookies.

The only downside to these cookies if there are any would be that it is a bit crumbly because of the lack of flour and butter and also that it can be a little too peanut butter-y - meaning at times, eating the cookies will sort of be like eating a spoonful of peanut butter - again not necessarily a bad thing, but it can stick to your teeth.  And yes, did I mention this recipe is extremely peanut butter heavy?

Tips: I heard someone had added a teaspoon of baking soda to the recipe and that made the cookie a bit more crispy and less crumbly.  I also recommend adding 1/2-3/4 cup sugar instead of the full cup as it would be way too sweet.  I sprinkled on a little coarse salt on top of the cookies before I baked them because I think that really brings out the peanut butter flavor. Also, because it is the fall and I had a bag of dried cranberries, I decided to mix those in as well.  The flavor was delicious, but the oven has the tendency to dry out the cranberries, so what I would recommend is to rehydrate the cranberries either in some water or orange juice before putting them into the batter.

Everything in one bowl: peanut butter eggs, sugar, vanilla, salt
