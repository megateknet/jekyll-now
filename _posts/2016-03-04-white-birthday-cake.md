Throughout my time as a baker, it was an extremely versatile and valuable tool to have a winning, white cake recipe.  You can use white cakes for weddings, birthdays and other social events.  This is my go-to cake when I want something that is not too sweet and is the perfect base for frostings, buttercreams and other embellishments.

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Using a mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar on medium high speed until pale and fluffy. 
3. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour and baking powder.  In another bowl, add the vanilla to the milk.  Alternate adding the flour mixture and the milk into the butter, starting and ending with the flour mixture.  Set aside.
4.  In a mixer with the balloon whisk attachment, beat egg whites, salt and sugar until stiff peaks.
5. Gently fold whites into the batter mixture.  
6. Pour batter into a greased 8-inch cake pan.  Bake for about 35 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
