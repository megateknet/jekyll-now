When I was studying in Taiwan, my favorite thing to get near the Shilin MRT stop were these super flakey scallion pancakes.  Now, most recipes say their pancakes come out "flakey", but I think that's mainly for show.  These scallion pancakes in Taiwan were FLAKEY almost in a puff pastry sort of way.  Each of the layers weren't as crispy as puff pastry, but the layers were definitely comparable. And so when I came home and tried making authentic Taiwanese scallion pancakes, I spent hours trying to recreate the layers by folding the dough back and forth, back and forth.  I got pretty good at making scallion pancakes, but they were never like the ones in Taiwan...Until it dawned on me one day, it wasn't necessarily the folding back and forth that made the pancakes flakey, it was the lard they put in it!  I had looked into some recipes that had lard in it, but most recipes call for oil and the thing is, oil doesn't do the trick.  Texturally, the pancakes in Taiwan had this rich crispiness to it, almost like the dough to a deep dish pizza.  So thus came the development of this recipe.  I felt I almost got the same texture from empanada dough and thought if I mixed in scallions and some sesame oil I would get that same feel.  The only thing with this quick recipe is that I used shortening instead of lard and I omitted all the folding.  If you want more flakiness, treat it just like pie dough or puff pastry. Roll out the dough, fold it into thirds, roll out again, fold, and repeat.  I actually don't think the pancakes need it it.  It quickens up the recipe a ton, and there's hardly any kneading.  Put in some extra sesame seeds for extra crunch and you can serve either with a soy sauce or a sweet chutney works as well.
