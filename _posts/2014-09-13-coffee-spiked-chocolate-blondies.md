Blondies are basically chocolate chip cookies in brownie form. The term is a cross between...you guessed it - blond and brownies, hence blondies!  

I wasn't too big of a fan until I tried one packed, and I mean really really packed, with chocolates - both white and dark, nuts, and coconut.  Any other form of a blondie makes it taste too dry and frankly, more like a cookie than a brownie.  Because you lose that fudginess you get from a brownie's chocolate base (yes, the best brownie batter recipes are made with nearly all melted chocolate), you have to try and make up for that by just packing your blondies with loads and loads of chocolate.  

Now this may be extreme, but the kind of blondies I go crazy over are probably 95 percent chocolates, nuts, and other fillers and five percent of the actual background blondie batter.  It's just the way I like it!  

Anyways, for this recipe, I decided to add another flavor that traditionally pairs well with chocolate - coffee.  And because I used the instant version, it really doesn't affect the batter consistency all that much.  Coffee just kind of accentuates all that chocolate flavor, not to mention these blondies can provide that quick "pick-me-up" if you do happen to bring one to work for lunch.

Key tips to remember - this is an easy recipe.  The only thing you can mess up on is overbaking it.  Every oven is different, but I would err on the side of underbaking than overbaking.


###Directions
