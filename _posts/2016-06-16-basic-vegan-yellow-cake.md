If you're vegan or have friends and family with dietary restrictions, knowing how to make a basic vegan yellow cake can be mighty handy when it comes to dessert time.  You can turn this recipe into cupcakes or serve the actual cake alongside some non-dairy whipped cream and fruit and you've got yourself a really nice and simple dessert.  Still a basic yellow cake becomes very useful when you're talking about birthdays, weddings and all the other various holidays when you want to bring something sweet to the party.

I think if there's one big issue I have with vegan cakes is that they are way too dense.  It's probably because there is no egg to add in additional moisture or lift the cake, but I found a way to adjust this a bit by cutting the normal all-purpose flour with a little cake flour.  I'll say the texture is still not the same as a cake made with eggs, but it is a lot less dense.

Because a basic vegan cake is more or less almond milk and flour, it's good to flavor it with different extracts or even better, fruit.  I will regularly throw in a couple blueberries or raspberries and bake it that way.
