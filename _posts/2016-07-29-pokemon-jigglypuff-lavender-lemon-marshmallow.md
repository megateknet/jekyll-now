It is amazing how popular Pokémon Go has gotten.  I'm hearing names and terms I haven't heard since I was in middle school.  Now, I'm not the biggest gamer, but I remember watching Pokémon when I was young and Jigglypuff was one of my favorite characters.

Naturally, the pink fluffy character reminded me of a giant marshmallow, and so when I was thinking of a recipe to do with Pokémon I wanted to do a big, giant Jigglypuff.  I happen to have some silicone whiskey ice makers lying around and thought they would be perfect for the job.

This is an easy recipe, but not an easy project because marshmallows are really sticky and hard to work with.  If you don't plan on setting your marshmallows in a big pan and then cutting them up, it becomes exponentially more difficult and messy to try and pipe the mixture into the shapes you want.  Still, it's a fun project and if you put some creativity into it, you can make whatever character you want.

A big tip I have to give when piping the marshmallow mixture is to pipe a majority of the shape you want onto the cornstarch and powdered sugar mixture, but as you end the shape, pipe it onto an area that has no powder.  It's almost the only way to do it because otherwise, the whole marshmallow refuses to break off and just continues sticking onto the piping tip.

Most of the time spent on this recipe were on the decorations.  I melted some white chocolate, mixed two different types of blue, made pink circles for the cheeks and piped triangles with dark chocolate for the ears.

Besides the giant puff ball, I piped the hair piece for Jigglypuff and also two small puffs for the ears.  If you're interested in just making normal marshmallows, then just pipe out the mixture into long logs.  Dust them with the cornstarch and powdered sugar mixture and cut them after they set.

### Directions

1. Bloom gelatin with 1/3 cup of water.  Set aside for 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, bring 1/3 cup of water, the sugar, salt and corn syrup to 240 degrees Fahrenheit.
3. Put bloomed gelatin into the microwave for 10 seconds.  Pour gelatin into a mixing bowl.  With the balloon attachment, start mixing on low speed while slowly pouring in the sugar syrup.  Once the mixture is cool enough, whip on high speed for about 10 minutes.
4. Two minutes before the mixing is done, add in the flavoring and food coloring.
5. In a separate bowl, mix together the cornstarch and powdered sugar.  When marshmallow mixture is finished mixing, pipe shapes onto a sheet of parchments generously dusted with the cornstarch mixture.
6. To form the marshmallow balls, grease and dust the insides of the silicone mold with oil and cornstarch mixture.  Carefully fill with marshmallow mixture.
7. Decorate with chocolate as desired.
