title: "Dong Quai Soup"

I wrote an article recently for Audrey Magazine's winter issue on Chinese  medicinal soups, and one of the soups I featured was Dong Quai.  I use the word "medicinal" mildly because these are really soups that moms make for their families - usually as preventative measures to keep everyone healthy.  It's usually drank after dinner, and the one I'm preparing today is seasonally appropriate.

I wanted to use herbs that were readily accessible at any Asian grocery store.  The astralagus root is one of those.  It is used to strenthen the immune system and is often prescribed to treat colds and respiratory issues.  There is definitely an earthy herbal taste to it, but I think it's quite soothing, especially after you sweetened it up a bit with the jujubes, which are sort of like dates.

It's definitely seasonally appropriate and feels great drank warm on a cold day.  Traditionally, hard boiled eggs are put in to richen the soup.  Many people think making these herbal elixirs are a challenging feat, but with a lot of these health soups, it's simply finding the right ingredients and cooking the liquid long enough so that the medicinal properties are concentrated.

__Directions__

__1. Put all ingredients other than the dried logan fruit into a pot.  Bring to boil.__
