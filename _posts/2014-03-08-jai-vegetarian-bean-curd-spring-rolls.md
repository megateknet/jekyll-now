"Jai" is the Chinese word for vegetarian food.  Jai is eaten on special holidays and you'll usually find the best jai dishes at Buddhist temples, which usually have accompanying cafeterias. This particular recipe is unique because it's not like the typical crispy skin spring rolls. The wrap is made with layered bean curd sheets and then the rolls are fried creating a nice layered texture.  The crunchy outside pairs well with the tender vegetables and mushrooms on the inside.

A special note for the bean curd sheets are that these ones are located in the refrigerated section of the Asian grocery store.  There are some sheet that are dry and look very similar, but these are the refrigerated ones and are slightly moistened already.

Anyhow, the full recipe is below!

The ingredients - plate 1: celery, carrots, water chestnuts; plate 2: shitake and king mushrooms; plate 3:  garlic and ginger
