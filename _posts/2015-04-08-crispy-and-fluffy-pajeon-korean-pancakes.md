title: "Crispy and Fluffy Pajeon Korean Pancakes"

I recently visited [Meju](http://www.mejuboston.com/) - a quaint and homey Korean restaurant in Davis Square - and had the fluffiest pajeon, Korean pancake, ever.  There was still a light crispiness to the pancake, but it was similar to that of a beer-battered crust.


That got me thinking of how I could translate that into a recipe.  The difference between pajeon and your other Asian-style "pancakes" is in the flour.  Pajeon is made partially with rice flour and that is what gives the pancake it's lightness.  I went a couple steps further by adding an egg, which will give the batter some lift and also seltzer water to further add to the airiness, similar to the carbonation of a beer batter.  The result was light, fluffy, crispy perfection.

Note that you can add additional items like seafood and other fillings into the mix.  Just make sure the additions aren't too wet as that will affect the pancake's consistency.


__Directions__

__1. Cut scallion stalks into 1-inch long pieces.__
