Tough loss for Mexico...but the show must continue.  I have courses three and four coming up.  Course three will be a mix of the Dutch kroket filled with a Mexican-style corn on a cob with yummy queso fresco, lime, and cilantro.

The recipe is pretty original and the fried krokets were light and crunchy.  You get a nice mix from the tanginess of the cheese and lime juice and the sweetness from the corn.  A tip for this recipe would be to make sure and pack the krokets tightly before rolling them in bread crumb.  If it's not tightly packed, it may break apart during the frying stage.

Following that, I'm preparing for the Greece and Costa Rica game by making a classic Greek salad, but with a chilera dressing, which is made with the vinegar from chilera, which is a Costa Rican spicy sauce accompaniment made from vegetables and chilis.  (Now, the chilera does need to sit for 2 weeks to ferment, so this might not be a spur of the moment hot sauce.)

**Course 3:**

**Ingredients** 

For Cilantro and Lime Corn Krokets

- 2 ears of corn
- 1 tablespoon butter
- dash of salt
- 1 tablespoon cilantro, chopped
- 1 teaspoon lime juice
- 2 tablespoons queso fresco
- 1 egg
- 1/4 cup masarepa
- 1 1/2 breadcrumbs

###Directions

#### 1. Cut corn off the cob and saut√© with butter and salt over medium heat until corn turns golden brown.
