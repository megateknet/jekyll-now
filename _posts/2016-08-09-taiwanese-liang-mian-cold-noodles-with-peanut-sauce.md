Back in 2011 when I went to live in Taiwan for a year, "liang mian" or "cold noodles" was one of the first street foods I had, which I immediately took a liking.  My friend's mom had made it for us several days before, and I was taken by how simple it was.  Actually, I was surprised the noodles were served cold, which is a rarity especially with East Asian food.  But it made sense because Taiwan can get pretty darn hot in the summer and nobody wants to eat a hot bowl of noodles when the humidity and outside temperature is at its peak.

The dish is sort of like a salad.  You prepare all of the ingredients - the noodles, vegetables and eggs separately.  Then you make the dressing or rather the sauce and pour it over everything.  I made the sauce with peanut butter, but a lot of the liang mian I had in Taiwan used tahini, which was a lot more mellow in flavor, but it's so your choice as to which you prefer.

The sauce has the perfect blend of salt, sugar, spice and creaminess from the peanut butter.  The cucumber provides a nice cooling effect and the carrots gives the noodles a bite.
