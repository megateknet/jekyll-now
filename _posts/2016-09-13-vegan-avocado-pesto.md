This is such a delicious pesto recipe.  It's rich and flavorful with the avocado and basil and bright and surprisingly cheesy with the lemon juice.  I opted to make this recipe with pumpkin seeds, which are flavorful and full of nutrients instead of pine nuts, which are also so expensive.  Using seeds instead of nuts is a nice tip because you still get a very similar level of creaminess when you puree seeds as you do nuts.  And if you happen to have someone with a nut allergy, seeds are a very nice and often, less expensive alternative.

The recipe is super easy.  You put everything into a food processor and puree.  I will say that because it functions as both a spread/dip and sauce, you may find yourself needing to add a bit more salt or lemon juice if you are putting it on top of plain pasta.  For me, I love lemon juice.  I think it makes the rest of the flavors in the recipe pop.  It always tastes light and bright and I love it with salads, sandwiches and pastas.
