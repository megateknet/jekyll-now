I know that everyone is in search of lighter recipes after the holidays.  Well, I've got the perfect clean and light, yet flavorful and bright fish dish for you.  It combines the savory umami flavors of soy and shitake mushrooms with bright fresh flavors like citrus and cilantro.  And best of all, you cook it in parchment and it comes out pretty and perfectly cooked every single time.

__Directions__

__1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.__  

__2. Salt and pepper four 6-ounce pieces of white fish.__
