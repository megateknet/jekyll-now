Watermelons are synonymous with summer.  For me, watermelons conjure up memories of cookouts and barbeques, of pool parties and the summer heat.  There is nothing more refreshing than sinking your teeth into a big slab of watermelon in the peak of summer heat.

This popsicle recipe is meant to capture the essence of summer in not only the taste, but sight as well.  The little frozen pops can be amazing, show stopping pieces at any summer party.  The sweetness from the watermelon is ever so slightly offset by the tartness from the kiwis.  The small layer of sweetened coconut milk in the middle mellows and enriches the flavors above and below it.  The fruits and coconut complement each other perfectly making for the perfect summer treat.

__Note:__ The only big tip I can give on this simple recipe is to make sure every new layer you are adding is cold.  For example, as the watermelon layer freezes, it's a good idea to stick the coconut milk and kiwi in the refrigerator.  This helps when you pour on the new layer, so that it doesn't melt the old, which would make for a slightly messier presentation.

Also, the stevia or sugar amounts are just guidelines.  One packet of stevia equals 2 teaspoons of sugar and how much you add really depends on how ripe your fruit is, so adjust to taste.
