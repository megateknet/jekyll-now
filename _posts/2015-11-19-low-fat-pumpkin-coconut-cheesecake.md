title: "Low-Fat Pumpkin Coconut Cheesecake"

This is an amazing cheesecake that I paired up with Vitasoy (think tofu) to create for their holiday campaign last year.  The flavors of coconut and pumpkin pair so perfectly together because although both are mellow flavors, the sweetness from the pumpkin makes the coconut more pronounced.  The flavors turn into this fragrant and creamy concoction, which surprisingly is done without a lot of fat.  

Silkened tofu is used to replace a lot of the cheese, but a little mascarpone is added back in for richness.  If you're looking for a vegan recipe, feel free to replace the mascarpone with vegan cream cheese or make it fully with tofu.
