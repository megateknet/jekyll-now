GREEN TEA TOFU MOUSSE CAKE
Light yet creamy mousse cake with a strong hit of aromatic green tea flavor 


__Directions__

__Green Tea Crust and Mousse:__

1. Line the sides of an 8-inch spring form pan with acetate. (Note: Acetate may be omitted.)
2. Put biscuits in a zip lock bag and crush cookies into coarse pieces. 
3. Toss biscuits with butter and press into the bottom of the pan. 
4. In a small saucepan, bring soymilk and honey to a boil. Turn heat down to medium. Add in gelatin and stir till dissolved. 
5. In a bowl with the egg yolks, whisk in a little bit of the hot liquid to temper. Pour egg mixture back into the soymilk and cook on medium heat for 30 seconds to 1 minute or until mixture coats the back of a spoon. Strain mixture into a bowl. Set aside. 
6. Meanwhile, vigorously whisk 1/3 cup pureed tofu and green tea powder until there are no lumps. 
7. Pour tofu mixture into egg mixture and whisk until smooth. Set aside. 
8. In a mixer with the balloon whisk attachment, whip the whipping cream and sugar on high until stiff peaks. 
9. Gently fold whipped cream into the green tea mixture. 
10. Pour mixture on top of cookie crust. Smooth the top with a spatula until flat, making sure there are no gaps on the edges between the mousse and cake pan. Refrigerate for 4-5 hours or until mousse sets.

__Green Tea Ganache:__ 

1. Melt white chocolate over a double boiler or in the microwave. 
2. Meanwhile in a small bowl, mix several tbsp. of the soymilk with the green tea powder and whisk until it is smooth. 
3. In a small saucepan, mix the rest of the soymilk, gelatin, and green tea mixture together. Heat mixture and stir until gelatin dissolves. Do not bring to a boil. 
4. Pour hot soymilk mixture over melted white chocolate and whisk till smooth and combined. If there are lumps, a strainer may be used. 
5. When the green tea mousse has set, pour ganache over cake and use a spatula to smooth the ganache over if necessary. 
6. Refrigerate for about 2 hours or until ganache sets.
