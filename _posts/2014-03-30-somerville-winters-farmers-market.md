Farmer's markets aren't just a summer thing anymore.  Last week, I went to the Somerville Winter's Farmer Market on Highland Avenue and found hidden treasures that I would have otherwise not known to exist - especially during winter time.  What's neat is that the market located in an old armory and there's a cafe for market goers just outside of the hall.  The market runs from early December through mid-April, and although most of the farm stand items are root vegetables this time of the year, the market actually hosts a bunch of other food items like meats, cheeses, pastas, bakery items, and even kombucha and coffee.  

The atmosphere is quite laid back - faint streams of light peek through the old armory windows towards the back and murmurings of vendor and customer conversations can be heard throughout. I would say definitely don't be shy to ask for samples - including if you want to try a fruit or vegetable you are not familiar with.  The vendors will actually cut a piece for you as all of them are eager to talk get market goers to try their products.
