This was a dish I perfected in college - a bright pesto pasta paired with small chunks of tuna throughout.  It's a perfect 3rd course for our 'Back to School' 5-Course menu series.  Check out the site for the rest of the courses. Recipe (Serves 2-3): 1/2 box of spaghetti, 2 tablespoons pesto, 1/4 lemon (juiced), 1 can of tuna (with 1-2 tablespoons brine reserved)
