With Easter approaching, I wanted to do a dessert with coconut, but not your run-of-the-mill Easter cake.  I wanted something luxurious and decadent, and well - internet worthy.  Now, this is no "cookie shot glass" (then again what is?), but it is a pretty delcious cake with all the creamy trimmings and um, coconut!  I call it dulce de leche coconut tres leches.  

So I found Chow's [Coconut Tres Leches Cake Recipe](http://www.chow.com/recipes/10649-coconut-tres-leches-cake), which seemed to be pretty well received and tried that first.  The cake was good, but I found it needed a little more milk for the soaking to really achieve that tres leches consistency and also a bit more sweetness - which is not something I usually say about cake recipes.

So I did my usual meddling of the recipes.  I actually increased the amount of evaporated milk in my tres leches soaking liquid to get a more concentrated milk flavor in my sponge cake.  I also added more sugar and a little bit of cream cheese to the cream topping I spread on top of the cake.  The original recipe basically called for whipped cream that was very mildly flavored and that made sense to pair a light whipped cream with a denser and sweeter cake.  But the dichotomy was so different that it actually tasted a little strange.  I didn't make it a ton sweeter, so don't worry, and just a tad of cream cheese gave the topping a little more body and backbone.  Oh right, I almost forgot.  I topped the whole thing off with dulce de leche.  I thought since we were soaking with milk, it would only be fitting to top it off with milk.

Some notes about this recipe - the leavening in the cake is purely from the whipped yolks and whites, so make sure when you mix them to fold them gently.  Resist the urge to fold until everything is combined because you will deflate the eggs that way.  There can still be little pockets of whites in your yolks.  With flour, it's a bit more tricky, but just do enough until you don't see it.  You'll see in the pictures I took how this looks like.

It's also good when you're whipping eggs to have them at room temperature or even warm them a bit.  They get more volume that way.  With the egg whites, remember to only whip them to medium peaks, which can still look a bit foamy.  They are at their highest volume then, so resist the urge to whip to that pretty glossy stage, which I know is tempting, but by the time your whites look like that, it's overwhipped.
