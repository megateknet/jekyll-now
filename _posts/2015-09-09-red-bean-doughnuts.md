This is a doughnut recipe I did for Vitasoy in their baking with tofu campaign.  The doughnuts are still light and fluffy, but with a fraction of the calories.  And the red azuki bean filling adds a lightly sweetened filling that provides a ton of moisture to the doughnuts.  Directions and recipe follow.  A video of the recipe can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ly3Xaw1kFw).

RED BEAN TOFU DOUGHNUTS
Decadent cakey doughnut with a smooth and creamy red bean center 


__Directions__

1. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, spices, and salt in a bowl. 
2. In a mixer on medium speed, cream your butter and 6 tbsp. of sugar together. 
3. Add in egg, apple cider, and 1/4 cup pureed tofu. Mix wet ingredients on low to medium speed until combined. 
4. On low speed, add in dry ingredients and mix until dough starts coming together. Dough will be somewhat wet. 
5. On a well-floured surface, form small round dough balls in your hand and flatten dough to between 1/4-inch to1/2-inch thickness. 
6. On medium low heat, heat several inches of oil (about 375 degrees Fahrenheit). 
7. Fry donuts for about 1 minute each side or until dark golden brown. 
8. Roll donuts in reserved sugar and set aside to cool. 
9. While donuts are cooling, whisk together red bean paste and enough soymilk so that mixture is smooth and able to be piped. 
10. Fill piping bag fitted with an eclair attachment. Pipe filling into the side of the donut or pipe a small mound right on top.
