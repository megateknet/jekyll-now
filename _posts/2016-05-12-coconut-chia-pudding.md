When it comes to an easy, vegan, homemade dessert it doesn't get any simpler than this chia seed pudding.  Chia seeds naturally form this gel around them once it comes into contact with a liquid, making the whole mixture a pudding consistency.  

There's obviously great benefits with chia seeds, which are high in omega fatty acids, fiber and protein.  I guess some people might find it weird at first.  It's essentially eating somewhat of a slimy seed - ok, I'm not helping the cause, but it's more jelly than slimy.  Once you get used to it though, it's the easiest (just mix everything together and refrigerate) and most fun dessert to eat.

I used half coconut milk and almond milk in mine, but you can add any liquid in there that suits your liking, even fruit juices.  I also used stevia in the video, but because there is that slight bitter aftertaste, I would maybe do a half-half with sugar or another sweetener.
