So last weekend when I went to get my usual Sunday treat from [Union Square Donuts](http://unionsquaredonuts.com/menu/), I happened to stumble upon this hole-in-the-wall called [Machu Chicken](http://machuchicken.com/machuchicken/).  I think "stumble upon" is the wrong word.  The moment I left the donut shop, I caught this smell of amazing charcoal goodness.  I didn't know what it was.  It could have been any meat, but man did it smell good.  When I finally tracked it down toe Machu Picchu Charcoal Chicken and Grill, I was surprised to find another party of three saying the exact same thing I did - that they had to find out where this amazing smell came from.

I went in and this place wasn't really that big.  The decor reminded me of an outdoor Hawaiian bar, which can be rather fun.  Anyhow, there were a ton of Peruvian dishes on the menu and even a drink called chica morada, which is made with purple corn.  But even with the abundance of choice, I went straight for their signature - the charcoal chicken, and man, did I make the right choice.  I knew I had to go home and find a recipe.

My recipe was adapted from [Serious Eats Peruvian Style Grilled Chicken](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/08/peruvian-style-grilled-chicken-with-green-sauce-recipe.html).  Now I baked this chicken, which I'll have to admit, took away that amazing charcoal goodness, but the spice rub for this recipe is amazing and I'll be happy to make it a part of any of my meals.  Maybe I'll try this again in the summer when I have the charcoal grill out.
