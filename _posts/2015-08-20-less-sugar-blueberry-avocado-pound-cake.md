There are not a lot of desserts where when you take fat and sweetness from it that it still tastes good.  While I didn't go too extreme with this recipe (had tried that with an earlier one - fail) - substituting a stick of butter for an avocado and reducing the sugar by a little over a third, it still came out delicious and moist with that rich, buttery, pound cake flavor.

I think the secret with "healthier" desserts is not to over-do it on the health factor.  I mean, there are a lot of good recipes using healthy ingredients and cutting out all sugar, but in my experience, they are hard to come by. In this particular recipe, avocados are a perfect substitute for butter because it is still rich, but doesn't impart a lot of flavor.  

In terms of sugar, I find that in a lot of Western dessert recipes, you can easily take out about a third of the sugar and get away with it.  The recipe is still sweet and if anything, you can taste the other ingredients (butter, vanilla, blueberries) better because it's not covered in all that sweetness.

__Tips for the recipe:__

- Make sure to use ripe avocados.  It's creamier and easier to mash up that way.
- Use room-temperature butter.  It will mix more homogenously with the avocados.
- Don't grease the sides of the pan.  Just like angel food cake, you want the cake to have something to grab onto so it won't collapse.  Since this cake has a fair amount of leavening, but is on the heavier side, it will have a tendency to do that.

__Directions__

__1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  Start by mixing the avocados with mixer on medium speed until smooth.  Then add softened butter and mix on medium-high till fluffy and smooth.__
