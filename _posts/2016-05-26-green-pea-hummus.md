Because many people have an allergy to sesame, I wanted to find a hummus recipe that did not contain tahini.  I also wanted to use something that tasted fresher and more spring-like than chickpeas, so green peas really seemed to fit the bill.  In addition, this recipe has no cheese, which may worry some people, but along with the basil and lemon juice, it is packed with flavor goodness and you would not be able tell that it's missing anything.

So, I've come across a lot of vegan recipes lately, and there have only been a handful that have hit it out the park for me.  This is one of those recipes.  I can use it as a hummus or cheese substitute because the beans and lemon juice make this dip taste sort of cheesy.  You don't really get stuffed after, and the ingredients it uses makes the whole dip really refreshing.
