I’m not a big fan of frosted cakes. I usually find them unnecessarily sweet, and I don’t like how the flavors of the frosting cover up the flavors of the cake.  I do, however, enjoy cakes when they are coming right out of the oven.  They're warm and moist and flavorful.  Two  cakes that I have been obsessed with lately are the coconut cake, which is this dense yellow cake with flecks of coconut baked right in, and the rum cake.  I decided to combine them both and make this absolutely rich rum butter soaked coconut cake.  It’s good served warm and right out of the oven, but it’s even better the second day when the rum has had time to properly soak through the cake.  It's the perfect "grown-up" cake that puts just the right amount of kick into the last course.

A comment about this cake is that it may initially be difficult to fold the whites into the yolks batter.  The batter is very thick and the whites are quite light, so just be patient and fold in part of the whites to lighten the batter.  Don't worry too much about deflating the whites when you initially do this.  Also, try using a cake pan that has taller sides as the cake does rise just a little.

**Directions**

####1. Using the Paddle Attachment, Cream Butter and Yolks for 4-5 minutes. On a Low Speed, Mix in Vanilla.
