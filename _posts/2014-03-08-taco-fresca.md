So I was at the farmer's market this past Wednesday and came upon the best looking fruits and vegetables.  I think farmer's markets are one of my most favorite things that happen during the summer.  Sure sometimes the prices maybe a bit higher that your local grocery store, but everything is just so much fresher!  And I don't know if people like this, but I love that not everything is the same size.  What I mean is that the strawberries are not all gargantuan.  They're usually a lot smaller, with some big ones in between.  And the eggs - different sizes and different colors.  Everything is just gorgeous.

I was thinking about making tacos for dinner anyway, so I just browned up some turkey - I like mine fairly lean, so 93% meat to 7% fat usually fares well.  I mixed that with some taco mix and just put the taco together with the fresh vegetables.  To kick things up though, I was able to get a hold of mizuna, which is a favorite green of mine.  It has a slight mustard-y flavor and really puts a bit more "umph" in the taco.
