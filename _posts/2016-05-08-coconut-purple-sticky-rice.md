This is an Asian take on your classic rice pudding.  It's made with gorgeously vibrant purple rice (which I think is sold as black rice as well).  It is then sweetened and flavored with a rich and fragrant mixture of evaporated milk and coconut milk.

Because purple rice is a harder grain, it is important to soak it prior to making the recipe.  However, because it is a harder grain, it gives a nicer bite to the dessert than say a softer rice pudding.

### Directions

3. Put in the rice and bring back to a boil.  Turn it down to a low simmer and cook for 45 minutes, until rice becomes slightly more tender.
4. After 45 minutes, add in the sugar and salt and cook for an additional 30-45 minutes.
5. After 30-45 minutes, add in the coconut and evaporated milk and stir until combined.  Continue to simmer for about another 10 minutes, until rice is the tenderness you desire.
