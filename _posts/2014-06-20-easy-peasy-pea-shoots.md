One of the best things about summer are the open farmer's markets that spring up.  You get the freshest and most local produce.  And even though the fruits and vegetables are slightly more expensive than they are at the supermarket, it's definitely worth it to buy it there.  The fruits are sweeter and vegetables are crunchier...it's just better, I promise.

#### Union Square Farmer's Market

Anyways, I was lucky enough to pick up some pea shoots while I was at the Union Square farmer's market last week, and usually, I only see these towards the beginning of summer (and only towards the beginning of when the farmer's market is open, so get there early!)  I love pea shoots because even though they're delicate, they still retain some bite after cooking.  I would say that if you like spinach, but still desire more chew and texture, then pea shoots are your thing.  They remind me a tad of potato leave shoots, which are similar in texture. 

Anyways, this is a super simple recipe with just some garlic, oil, and salt, but I finished the whole bunch of pea shoots by myself because it was just so delicious.  If you like things spicier, I would say chili peppers would be a wonderful addition as well.

### Directions

#### Fry up some sliced garlic in olive oil till golden brown.
