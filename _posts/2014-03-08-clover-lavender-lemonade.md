I thought I'd do a quick write up on Clover's Lavender Lemonade. If you're someone who likes herb infused drinks whether it be rosemary or thyme or lemon verbena infused tea, you have to give this a try.  I'm not usually a lemonade gal because usually it's made too sweet.  The lemonade is perfect because it isn't overly sweet and the lavender flavor really compliments the sourness from the lemons.  I also think it is the sourness from the lemons that take away that potentially soapy taste that people may associate with lavender when it does appear in food dishes.  It's really the perfect lemon-y and herb-y refresher.
