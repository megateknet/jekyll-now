Ginger scallion sauce is one of those go-to sauces you see at every Chinese restaurant.  It's especially popular in the Chinese barbecue shops that serve char siu, roasted duck and chicken -- you know, the ones that hang their meat right at the window for everyone to see.  You can always ask for a side of ginger scallion sauce to take home with your bbq-ed meats.

I did a video (coming up) accompanying this recipe as well and in there, I used a rotisserie chicken I bought from the supermarket.  It is much easier and saves a lot of time, but the sauce does work best with a poached chicken that has less seasoning sicne the sauce is already salty.  This sauce is also a good way to use up chicken you used to make homemade chicken stock, if you do that kind of stuff.  I always thought it was such a waste that people threw whole chickens out.  Well, this sauce is the perfect condiment to that chicken...and really any bland meat you're looking to pick up.

__Tips__

- There's nothing too hard about the recipe.  Grating the ginger does take a while, but you can try smashing the ginger pieces and then chopping it up to save time.  
- Warming the oil just a bit before pouring it into the ginger and scallions will help all the flavors release, creating a better sauce.
