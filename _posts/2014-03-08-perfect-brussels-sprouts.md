Every couple of years, I develop a new craving for some random food.  When I was 13, it was button mushrooms...never liked mushrooms before.  Then several years later, it was New York cheesecake - bad thing to start liking.  This year though, it was brussels sprouts.  I know...weird!  I didn't grow up with brussels sprouts, so it's not like I ever really experienced the "grossness" that is brussels sprouts as a kid.  I think what really happened was I had some brussels sprouts for a side at some restaurant I was eating at and was like, "Whoa!  These are good!"

It's a weird thing to start liking, I know.  I mean, they're sort of miniature cabbages, and yes, at times, I do sort of get that "sewer-esque" smell that brussels sprouts and cabbage have.  But, that doesn't turn me off like it does some people.  I think that "smell" contributes to the overall flavor that is the brussels sprout, and I love it.  I've tried preparing them several ways - stir fry, steamed, but no way is better that just oven roasted. So I'm just going to give a simple recipe for these - in case there are people like me who aren't so familiar with brussels sprout either.  I think the biggest mistake you can make is over cooking them, because you do want the crunch to stay.  At the same time, I like when parts of the brussels sprouts brown up, so the way to get the best of both worlds is roasting at a high heat, but only for a short period of time.
