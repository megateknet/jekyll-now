title: "Blackberry Tomato Fruit Crumble"

I was originally going to name this recipe the "any fruit" fruit crumble, which it is, but I really wanted to spotlight this fruit and tomato combination and show how good tomatoes are in desserts. 

I mixed tomatoes with a majority blackerry (and some peaches).  What was nice was that the tomatoes picked up the tartness from the blackberries.  Though because tomatoes are not naturally as sour, they offered a nice respite from the tartness as well.  That in conjuction with the tomatoes' texture (and even the chewiness of the skin) made the crumble filling quite amazing.

I sweetened the fruit just a tad with about one to two tablespoons of brown rice syrup and surprisingly, that was all the sweetness it needed.  The fruit really did the talking.

I topped the berries, peaches and tomatoes with my [high protein almond flax crumble topping](http://eastmeetskitchen.com/recipes/high-protein-almond-flax-crumble-topping.html).  I think everything worked because the crumble is a bit like granola and granola works very well with fruit.

This is a recipe that works super well with frozen fruit as well.  So if you have some crumble topping in the freezer (it freezes quite well), just thaw some of it out and crumble it over about a bag and a half of frozen fruit.  It's an impromptu dessert that will be very impressive.
