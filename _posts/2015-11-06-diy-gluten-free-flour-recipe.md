I occasionally add gluten-free flour to recipes to actually lighten them up.  I find that it's similar to using cake flour, where a larger percent of the flour is comprised of starches as opposed to wheats. 

Obviously, there are people with gluten allergies and sensitivities as well, so being able to use it and have it contribute to the texture of baked goods is great.  My only tip is that sometimes gluten-free flour can make baked goods more dry, so play around with possibly adding a bit more liquid or a tad more oil or fat to the mix.
