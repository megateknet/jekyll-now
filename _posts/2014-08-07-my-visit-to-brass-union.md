excerpt: "I have to talk about a new bar that opened up in Union Square last month. Brass Union took over the spot where Precinct used to be, and although I can't vouch for its menu because I haven't really eaten there yet (except for the choripan which was um...amazing), I can say they make a spectacular drink. Oh, and did I mention they have a super cool lounge area in the back where you can play board games!"

I have to talk about a new bar that opened up in Union Square last month.  [Brass Union](http://www.brassunion.com/) took over the spot where Precinct used to be, and although I can't vouch for its menu because I haven't really eaten there yet (except for the choripan which was um...amazing), I can say they make a spectacular drink.  Oh, and did I mention they have a super cool lounge area in the back where you can play board games! Forget about the crowded Boston bars with its obnoxiously loud music and overpriced covers. If you want a great bar to chill at and play Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots with your friends, then Brass Union is your place.

I had this drink - the one you see at the top of the page called the Esqueleto.  Oh my gosh was it amazing.  It's made with Espolon tequila blended with a house coffee reduction.  Then lemon and Thai chili peppers are added, so it sort of tastes like a spicy ice tea.  The bartender that day added a ton of Thai chili, so sometimes it got difficult to drink, but the kind of difficult you would go back to sip and sip again.  

Now, I'm not the type that likes the actual flavor of alcohol - like a single malt scotch would be wasted on me, but I also don't like when a cocktail just tries to cover up the alcohol flavor with excessive sugar and fruit - hence most "girly drinks."  I love cocktails where the other ingredients in it complement the flavor of the alcohol, thus making it taste less alcohol-y, if you will.  And for the Esqueleto, the slight bitterness from the coffee really balanced out the tequila, and the other flavors like the lemons and the chili just popped out at you.

Anyways, here's their cocktail menu.  If you're ever down by Somerville, definitely check them out.
