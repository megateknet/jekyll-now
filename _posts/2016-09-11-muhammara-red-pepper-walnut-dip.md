I tried muhammara for the first time several months ago at a Middle Eastern bakery for lunch.  I love when I see nuts in sauces because nuts provide that added creaminess and richness without all the fattiness of dairy.  I also liked that the dip was substantial.  It was thick and comprised of red bell peppers, scallions, walnuts, pomegranate molasses and some spices.  Just by looking at the ingredients you can see the dip has savory and sweet elements, which is the perfect combination for me.

If you don't have an open-flame stove, then roast your red pepper in a 500 degree Fahrenheit oven until the skin blisters.  Then cover it with a piece of plastic wrap for several minutes to let the pepper steam.  The skin should come off easily after.

I was able to find Aleppo pepper online and since this dip is from the Aleppo region, I would suggest trying to get your hand on this mild pepper.  If not though, you can substitute for chili powder.  Just be sure to taste so that it's at the level of spiciness you want.  

Also, don't go too crazy with the pomengranate syrup.  It's quite a novel product, and so I did get excited using it.  However, it does get quite sweet, so make sure to taste as you go.  If you're looking for more of a savory dip, I would start off adding a little less syrup than called for.
