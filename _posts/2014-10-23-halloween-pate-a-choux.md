We've all seen the cookies decorated with ghosts, spiders, or gravestones... and the cupcakes with the over-the-top, in-your-face bright orange frosting sprinkled with black and orange jimmies.  I wanted to move away from the familiar, and make Halloween just a bit more...sophisticated - sophisticated, but still super fun!

I wanted to stay away from artificial ingredients (yes the pictures have sprinkles on them...), so I added black sesame powder to the p√¢te a choux puffs and made pastry cream using pumpkin puree, which not only provided a natural sweetness, but made the cream bright orange as well.

You can be as creative as you want in decorating these guys.  Once you have the puffs filled, it's a matter of creating some legs with chocolate and sticking them right in to make spiders.

Tips - the hard part about this recipe is probably the pastry cream as the egg can easily curdle.  But if you temper the eggs prior with a little bit of the hot liquid and make sure the heat is turned down to medium, you can control how the mixture thickens a lot better.  And because we have the gelatin in there, you don't have to worry too much about whether you have heated the mixture to the exact point where it will thicken later.  Any lumps that do form can be strained out and you will have the perfect pastry cream.

__Directions__
__For Black Sesame Choux Puff:__

__1. Combine water and butter in a pot and have the dry ingredients - flour, black sesame powder, sugar, and salt - combined in a bowl.__

__6.With a pastry bag and round metal tip, pipe choux paste into the size of ping pong balls.  The tip on the top can be flattened by using fingers dipped in a bit of water.__

__2.In a sauce pan, bring milk and gelatin to a boil.  Turn down to medium heat.__

__3.Add some of the hot liquid to the egg mixture to temper. Pour egg mixture back into pot and cook for about a minute until mixture coats the back of a spoon.  If lumps form, mixture can be strained after.__

__4. Pour pastry cream into a bowl and fold in pumpkin puree.__

__5. Put pastry cream in refrigerator to set for about 2-3 hours.__

__6.This part is optional, but if you are looking for a lighter filling, beat a half cup of heavy cream to stiff peaks and fold this into the pastry cream.__

__Assembly:__

__1.Fill puffs with a pastry bag fitted with an eclair tip or a small round tip.  Have a little bit of the pastry cream peak out for a colorful effect.__

__2. Dust with powdered sugar and decorate with your favorite Halloween candies and decorations.__
