title: "Easy Yellow Rice"

Yellow rice with a little bit of green herbs is the easiest way to dress up a not so interesting meal.  On days when all I feel like doing is getting a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, pairing it up with white rice and broccoli just seems too blah.  

But the problem is I don't want to spend a ton of time making rice.  Some yellow recipes require you to soften garlic or onions before browning the rice, then adding something expensive to it like saffron, and then finally putting in your chicken stock.  It's just - the reason I got my rotisserie chicken was because I didn't want to cook.  At the same time though, I don't want the store bought stuff that essentially tastes like one big pot of chicken bouillon cubes. So, one day when I was aching for some quick (yet still home-made) yellow rice - with all the fragrant flavors but without the consuming preparation time, I essentially put 5 aromatic ingredients into a rice cooker and let that go.  The results...pretty darn good yellow rice (well, on the fly anyway).
