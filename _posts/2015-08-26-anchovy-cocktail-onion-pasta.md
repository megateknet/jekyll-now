Course 4 of my 'Back to School' 5-Course menu special. Inspired from a meal in Venice, it's simple, cheap and pretty darn delicious. Check out the site for more easy back to school recipes.  Recipe (Serves 2-3): 1/2 box of spaghetti, 3-4 anchovies, 6-8 cocktail onions, several drops of anchovy oil, 1 tablespoon cocktail onion brine
